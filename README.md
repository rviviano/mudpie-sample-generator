# Mudpie Sample Generator
 Automatically create a bunch of processed audio samples from a mudpie 

 NOTE: ONLY WORKS WITH 16BIT and 24BIT WAV FILES AT THE MOMENT.

 A better name might have been "Mudpie Slicer" as the script doesn't generate mangled waveforms for you. Instead, the script takes an input wav file, pulls random samples between 300 and 3000 milliseconds, processes them, and then saves them as individual samples in the directory of your choosing. 

 Processing includes: bandpass filtering(20 Hz and 18 kHz), noise gating, random amplitude envelope generation, demeaning, detrending, normalization, and declicking.

## Getting Started
 These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your system.

 ### Prerequisites 
 * python https://www.python.org/
 * numpy  https://numpy.org/
 * scipy  https://www.scipy.org/
 * wavio  https://pypi.org/project/wavio/

 Tested with python 3.8 on Windows 10

 ### Installation 
 From the command line (Mac/Linux Terminal or Windows PowerShell).
 
 ```
 python -m pip install git+https://github.com/rviviano/mudpie-sample-generator.git@v0.1.2
 ```
 
## Usage
 pip should install the command line tool **mudsampgen**

 ### Linux/Mac Terminal and Windows PowerShell
 ```
mudsampgen --i <path to input wav> --o <directory to save output> --p <filename prefix for output samples> --n <number of samples to generate>
 ```

or
```
python -m mudpie_sample_generator --in <arg> --out <arg> --pre <arg> --num <arg> -h
```

#### Options Explanation
Mandatory Options:

    --i, --in      
        The mudpie, must be 16- or 24-bit int wav. No 32float yet. Also, it needs to be *much* longer than 10 seconds in length; otherwise, there is not much point in running this script.

    --o, --out     
        Directory to save output wavs to. If the provided directory path does not exist, then the script will try to create it.

    --p, --pre     
        Filename prefix for all output wav samples.

    --n, --num     
        Number of samples to generate (Maxes out at 400).

    Optional Options:

    -h             
        Print this usage message and exit
